              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>In 2016, Ohio University began a project to redesign their web presence. The main goals of the project
                were to modernize the overall appearance of the sites and make them more user-friendly and accessible.
                My role on this project was to work with stakeholders in a few departments to update the look and feel,
                streamline content for various audiences, and develop a process for proper maintenance.</p>
              <h2>Process</h2>
              <p>For each site, an audit was completed of the department’s current sitemap and file listing to
                give a high-level understanding of the items the department had available. Next, a meeting was conducted
                with each department to understand both their audience and their business objectives.
                This meeting had a few goals:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Determine which items in the site audit could be discarded in the migration.</li>
                <li>Categorize items based on intended audience.</li>
                <li>Develop content workflows to start planning for navigation structure in the new site.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In order to get audience feedback, a user survey was distributed campus-wide to see
                what items they found most important for their daily activities. The survey also asked users how well
                they were able to currently find specific items and information on the site as an attempt to test the
                current navigational structure. Following the surveys, a focus group of users was put together to ask
                more specific questions. During these focus group sessions, members were asked to complete a card sort.
                Topics within the task were taken directly from the survey as items users identified needing to find on
                a particular website. Results of this sort were analyzed to find correlations among categories and
                information locations. This gave a final dendrogram that helped to drive where information would be
                located within the new site.</p>
              <p>To validate the proposed navigational structure, one-on-one sessions with focus group
                participants incorporated a tree test. Users were asked to use the new navigation and walk through how
                they
                would go about finding specific topics of information. While the first round had items that proved
                difficult to find, a few tweaks to the navigation provided a navigational structure that seemed far more
                intuitive than the one initially in place.</p>
              <h2>Results</h2>
              <p>By the end of the project, the departmental sites had new navigational structures. This included not
                only
                the menu levels, but also quick-access links to the most used items. The goal was to lower the amount of
                time, and clicks, for users to get to their content, alleviating stress and frustration as the most
                common users were other employees. I was also able to clean up years of unused files, both in terms of
                outdated files and those not used by the site’s intended audience. To ensure potential link breakages or
                file duplication did not reoccur, staff members were given training on best practices for web files.</p>
