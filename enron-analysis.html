              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>In the 1990's, Enron was known as one of the most innovative and successful companies in the United
                States. Unfortunately, this success is not what most people think of today when they hear "Enron."
                Today, the company is most remembered for accounting and stock scandals that eventually ended with a
                bankruptcy declaration for the company.</p>
              <p>The amount of data that was made public following the investigation into Enron allows people to analyze
                for themselves what happened and who was likely involved. For this analysis exercise, I will label those
                expected to be involved as Persons of Interest (POIs). The dataset being used consists of 146 entries
                (18 persons of interest and 128 non-persons of interest) along with data concerning their financial
                involvement with Enron and their e-mail correspondence within the company. From that data, we will try
                to come up with a way to accurately classify a person as a POI or not.</p>
              <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
              <p>The Python package <code>pandas</code> was used to conduct the analysis. During analysis, one person
                was found to lack any entries in the financial or email features and so was removed. Another "person",
                The Travel Agency in the Park, turned up. While the company could have been a front for something more
                shady, it held very few data points and was also removed. Having little data about a person may skew the
                training algorithm as it must more heavily weight the variables present.</p>
              <p>On the feature (or variable) side of things, a DataFrame was utilized to see how many data entries
                existed for each feature. Calculations were done on the dataset as a whole, on POIs only, and on
                non-POIs. Some features showed extreme coverage &mdash; either very high or very low. The cells
                highlighted demonstrate this. I did not want any algorithms to notice perfect coverage for POIs and
                immediately assign anyone with a valid data point in that category POI status.

                </table>
                From there, the following features were introduced to the dataframe to incorporate removed data and
                normalize data points:
                <pre><code>
                    percentage_bonus = bonus / total_payments
                    percentage_salary = salary / total_payments
                    percentage_exercised_stock = exercised_stock_options / total_stock_value
                    percentage_from_poi = from_poi_to_this_person / to_messages
                    percentage_to_poi = from_this_person_to_poi / from_messages
                    percentage_shared_with_poi = shared_receipt_with_poi / to_messages
                  </code></pre>
              </p>
              <p>For additional exploration of outlier activity, <a
                  href="https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/" target="_blank">seaborn</a> was utilized to
                show boxplots of the possible features. While the boxplots showed numerous other points that may
                statistically be categorized as outliers, they corresponded to actual employees and were kept. For
                instance, what appears to be an unnaturally large bonus or stock option for a particular employee may be
                a sure sign of being involved with the scandal.</p>
              <p>Due to the low number of data points in the set, a Gaussian Naive Bayes classification was chosen as a
                first attempt to predict persons of interest. To choose features, <code>SelectKBest</code> and
                <code>f_classif</code> from Python's <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html"
                  target="_blank">scikit-learn</a> were utilized. This allowed all possible features to be given a score
                based on the significance the feature has in the model. Based on the scores, the following features were
                kept for use in the models:
                <table class="table table-sm table-striped">
                  <thead>
                    <tr>

                      <th>Score</th>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>In each of the following tests, validation was done using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
                  from sklearn. While accuracy gives an overall idea of how well an algorithm is performing compared to
                  others, precision and recall give more specific performance metrics. For the Enron data, high
                  precision will mean that the people labeled as POIs are unlikely to actually be non-POIs and high
                  recall will mean that the algorithm is not missing POIs that it should be catching. Results from each
                  algorithm are shown in the table below.</p>

                <p>While the 100% precision from the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm looks like a clear winner, the
                  recall is tied for lowest. So while no one is being incorrectly categorized as a POI, quite a few POIs
                  are overlooked. The Decision Tree algorithm yields the highest recall score, meaning that a true POI
                  is less likely to be overlooked. The precision lowered, however, meaning some non-POIs are being
                  incorrectly classified as a POI. In this particular scenario, though, I would opt for the Decision
                  Tree. I would rather have the machine classify <em>too many</em> POIs and have a person manually
                  investigate than to have someone overlooked.</p>
