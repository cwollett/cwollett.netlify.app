              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>2020 was certainly an interesting year. Politics aside, public health and safety took over the
                spotlight. While Public Health and Medical experts explored treatments and ways to stem the spread,
                others were more focused on how to keep the economy afloat in the interim. Working in a rural community,
                real-time economic data is often hard to obtain. Figures are often three months to an
                entire year old by the time the government source has released the data to the public. With unemployment
                numbers skyrocketing, that data started to be released with only about a week’s delay. That data
                suddenly became a top source for digging into how pockets of the state were faring with the stay-at-home
                orders being put into place.</p>
              <h2>Data Gathering</h2>
              <p>The state of Ohio has a website listing historical unemployment data. Unfortunately, the file format is
                PDF. While <code>tabula-py</code> is great for scraping from a PDF, the
                state’s format needed some hefty cleaning. As always, <code>pandas</code> proved to be a data nerd’s
                best friend to structure the data.</p>
              <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                A slight disclaimer on the data. The underlying data is unemployment insurance claims, not the standard
                unemployment rates. For the time frame discussed here, this only included W-2 workers, not
                those who may be self-employed or earning incomes in alternate ways. As such, take all the analysis
                and commentary below as <em>guesstimates</em>. Which, as this was mostly being used for trend
                comparison, should™ be okay.
              </div>
              <h2>Data Visualizing - Power BI</h2>
              <p>In Ohio, unemployment is typically higher in certain geographies. One of the first things I noticed
                when looking at this data was that suddenly the areas typically hit hardest by unemployment were on the
                low end of the scale. The second image on this post shows claims data from January 2020 compared to
                April 2020.</p>
              <p>The map from January shows counties in the Southeast portion of the state with the highest unemployment
                claims. While those areas are still feeling the effects, suddenly western and northern Ohio have much
                higher claim rates. Those with some industry knowledge in the United States might know that there’s a
                pocket of automotive manufacturing that overlaps Northwest Ohio. The auto industry definitely took a hit
                in productivity, and employment, during this time frame. Southeast Ohio has a number of companies
                that are part of the auto supply chain, but they also have a number in other manufacturing industries
                that seemed to be more resilient throughout the lockdown stages. Maybe a better representation would be
                to compare different regions of the state over time to see how each was affected by the unemployment
                claims. In the third image, you can see how the Southeast region started with the highest overall rate
                and has, thus
                far, seemed to recover more quickly. Or, was able to hold off on being overly affected in the first
                place.</p>
              <h2>Thoughts</h2>
              <p>As stated earlier, workforce data typically lags. So it will still be a few months before we start to
                see reports come out of the different Federal agencies to know what kind of effect there was on gross
                regional product and county-level jobs and establishments. For me, it was nice to finally see a positive
                come out of this. While there is very little to be excited about in 2020, this information seems to show
                that the economy here is a little more resilient than first thought. There have been concerns about
                diversification in rural areas, and while this region could certainly use some more of that, they have
                come a long way from that over-reliance on coal that caused economic woes years ago.</p>
