              <h2>Problem</h2>
              <p>After my first few months with a regional economic development (ED) organization, it was clear that the
                issue facing those in the ED world was far larger than just “landing the next big business.” In order to
                make that happen, there are numerous other factors in play: sites and buildings, utilities, incentives,
                and workforce.</p>
              <p>Workforce is an issue that seems to plague both business retention as well as business expansion. A
                business is not going to set up shop in an area where they will not be able to attract a full workforce.
                In addition, it is difficult for smaller businesses to expand, or sometimes even stay afloat, if their
                workforce is insufficient.</p>
              <h2>Investigation</h2>
              <p>After hearing about workforce being a significant issue for many of the businesses within my region, I
                decided to take a closer look into where the gap may be. My work gave me access to <a
                  href="https://www.economicmodeling.com/" target="_blank">Emsi</a>, a Labor Market Analytics service.
                That coupled with a few downloads from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/" target="_blank">National
                  Center for Education Statistics (NCES)</a> and I was ready for some investigation.</p>
              <p>Talent Gap Analyses are basically an analysis between <em>supply</em> and <em>demand</em>. The supply
                data came in the form of completion data for all accredited post-secondary institutions in the region.
                This is available for download from the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/" target="_blank">National Center
                  for Education Statistics (NCES)</a>. The demand data came from job postings. My workplace gave me
                access to <a href="https://www.economicmodeling.com/" target="_blank">Emsi</a>, a Labor Market Analytics
                service, which happened to have that report available. To connect the two datasets, crosswalks exist
                that map educational programs to the occupations they typically fill. You can then explore what kind of
                jobs for which you are over- and under-supplied. For economic development, this helps you figure out
                which companies would be good targets because your region will be able to supply the workforce. On the
                other hand, it can also tell you the areas you may need to talk to local institutions about to help
                start a talent pipeline to attract a different set of businesses.</p>
              <p>The job postings data showed Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers as the top in-demand job. As I
                looked down the list I saw similar items: Light Truck Drivers, Supervisors of Material Moving Workers,
                Driver/Sales Workers, etc. The high demand over time made me curious as to whether there was a gap in
                supply for my area.</p>
              <h2>Visualizing the Data</h2>
              <p>ArcGIS Pro is an incredible tool for geospatial analysis. It allows joining of spreadsheets to location
                layers which allowed the image at the top of this post to be created. Mapping the job postings showed
                that there is a massive need for truck drivers in our eastern-most county. That one county blows all
                others out of the water.</p>
              <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                As a note, I do know that Jefferson County is a bit of an outlier for economic development. <a
                  class="alert-link"
                  href=https://wtov9.com/news/local/mingo-junction-celebrates-jsw-steel-after-years-without-industry>JSW
                  Steel</a> moved in and there have been on-going talks about <a class="alert-link"
                  href=https://www.heraldstaronline.com/news/local-news/2019/07/jobsohio-awards-30m-grant-for-preparation-of-proposed-cracker-site/>an
                  ethane cracker nearby</a>. Not to mention the fact that the shale underlying that region is part of
                  the <a class="alert-link" href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=33512">most
                  productive in the nation</a>.
              </div>
              <p>Overall, the page's header image shows that there are institutions in neighboring areas that are
                producing far more truck drivers than we are. Since each of those areas have major metropolitan areas,
                they’re going to have far more job opportunities period. It will be difficult to pull a worker from that
                market as their rate of pay is typically higher. In order to combat this particular issue, our employers
                will either need to focus on attracting talent from the areas producing it, or we need to work with
                local educational institutions within the region to offer programs to produce truck drivers closer to
                home. In any case, this gives our team some further background into what is happening for this
                particular occupation as well as a process for us to investigate other talent pipelines in the region.
