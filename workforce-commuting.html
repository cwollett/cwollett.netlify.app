              <h2>Should I Stay or Should I Go?</h2>
              <p>The region where I live and work is considered rural. While there are cities dotted around with malls
                and entertainment options, the average person is not heading to the grocery store on foot. For many,
                heading to town to stock up on items once per week is the norm. While this has implications for quality
                of life on a private level, it also has an impact on people’s professions as well. If it takes you 30
                minutes to get to town to do your shopping, how far are you going to have to travel for decent work? How
                do you straddle the line between quality of life and quality of work?</p>
              <p>I have personally experienced the situation above. Drive an hour-and-a-half one way for work to offer
                up more opportunities and collaboration or stick closer to where I want to live and spend my free time
                at the cost of fewer job opportunities? In my opinion, this is one area economic development can assist.
                Regional economies do best when they are diverse. This allows them to recover more quickly if an
                industry suddenly plummets. This can be clearly seen in <a
                  href="https://wfpl.org/new-economic-data-show-appalachias-struggles-amid-coals-decline/">Appalachia
                  America following the coal decline.</a> While the local economy tries to recover, many seek work
                elsewhere. This analysis project attempted to determine just that.</p>
              <h2>Where Do All the Workers Go?</h2>
              <p>The <a href="https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/">OnTheMap tool</a> from the United States Census Bureau
                allows for exploration of the posed question. While their tool allows for some significant analysis, the
                website also has the underlying available for download for more in-depth analyses. The data is
                <strong>huge</strong>, unsurprising considering it consists of commuter quantities for each pair of
                locations across the country. I was able to write code to download the entire 2015 data set (recently
                updated for their 2017 release), merge the files, and restructure them to keep the relevant information
                for the state of Ohio.</p>
              <p>Within Ohio, it seems that no matter where you live, people travel to Columbus to work. Many companies
                seem to gravitate toward huge urban centers as it allows them to tap into a larger workforce and have
                more nearby amenities. Because of this, I decided to center my search around MSAs. Ohio itself has many
                of these, but given my region’s proximity to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, I wanted to include their
                nearest MSAs as well.</p>
              <p>Looking into the numerical side of the analysis, the numbers were staggering. Out of a 25 county region
                in Southeastern Ohio, nearly 100,000 people leave to work within a major metro area. That amounts to
                over 25% of the workers in the region going elsewhere for employment. Clearly a significant portion of
                our workforce travels outside of the region to bring home the bacon. But in order to really tell others
                where the workforce is going, I made the infographic at the top of the page.</p>
              <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                I need to include a disclaimer on the shading for the counties. As the legend states, shading is
                done based on overall number of workers within each county traveling to the designated MSAs. On a
                choropleth map, you typically want to stick with depicting normalized data. Audience matters, though. I
                made this for a regional economic development
                organization. They wanted to be able to show this to a company who is worried about workforce numbers
                and
                say, “All these people travel a long way to get to work each day. With the right job and competitive
                wages, they would probably want to be closer to home.” In that case, the raw numbers have a bigger
                impact.
              </div>
              <h2>Let's Get Curious!</h2>
              <p>Geospatial analysis allows for a clearer picture of what is happening when we talk about commuting
                patterns. It’s one thing to take a county and list the numbers of workers out-commuting and to which
                county. It’s much clearer to <em>map</em> that same data. The second picture on this post looks at the
                data from a single county's perspective. This map looks at Guernsey County and shades the top ten
                counties their residents go to for work. In this case, the highways act as an added piece of the
                analysis instead of just background graphics. The map shows the workforce trickles off along Interstate
                77. If that Highway were not there, the commuting patterns would likely differ. The same is true for
                Interstate 70 taking people west toward Columbus.</p>
              <p>Investigation into questions such as, “workforce within X minutes from the site,” which are common in
                economic development, are now possible with this data.
                I think it could also lead to conversations with Ohio Department of Transportation personnel. These maps
                can help paint gaps in ease of transportation. In the image above, for example, counties southeast of
                Guernsey do not show
                up in the top 10 work locations likely due to travel options. Roadways in that direction are curvy,
                two-lane state highways that are not as easy to traverse on a daily basis and may lead to less people
                incoming for work because of that.</p>
